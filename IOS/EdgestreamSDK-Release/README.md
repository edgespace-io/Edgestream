This is currently the preview release for the EdgestreamSDK Binary Release. 

## Getting Started Guide
Prior to starting development using the Edgestream SDK please ensure that you have the Xcode IDE installed on your local development machine.  The Latest Xcode release can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Add SDK to a newly created project or existing project in Xcode as embedded framework
1. [Download](https://github.com/edgespace-io/Edgestream/blob/master/IOS/EdgestreamSDK-Release/edgestreamSDK-Release.tar) edgestreamSDK-Release.tar for IOS and extract the Edgestream framework to the desktop using the tar command 
```bash
tar xvf edgestreamSDK-Release.tar ~/Desktop/
```

2. [Open or Create](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/BuildABasicUI.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW3) a new project in Xcode

2. Once in Xcode add framework as an embedded binary, by navigating to your Application Embedded Binaries settings clicking the plus sign and selecting the extracted framework edgesdk.framework on your desktop or location that you extracted the framework to.
